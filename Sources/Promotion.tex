\chapter{Higher-Rank Type Inference with Type Promotion}
\label{chap:Promotion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

\cite{gundry2010type} proposed type inference in context as a general foundation
for unification/type inference algorithms. The key idea is based on the notion
of information increase. However, their semantic definition of information
increase makes it hard to prove metatheory formally. Following their work, a
more syntactic foundation for information increase is presented by DK
(\cite{DK}) to deal with higher-rank polymorphism. However, the DK approach
produces duplication and cannot be easily generalized to handle more complicated
types.

In this section, we propose a strategy called \textit{promotion} that helps
resolve the dependency of existential variables in the framework of type
inference in context. As an illustration, \Cref{sec:pr:unif} applies promotion
to the unification algorithm for simply typed lambda calculus.
\Cref{sec:pr:subtypin} further proposes \textit{polymorphic promotion} to deal
with subtyping for higher-rank polymorphism. Finally, we briefly discuss how to promote
dependent types and gradual types in \Cref{sec:pr:discussion}.
