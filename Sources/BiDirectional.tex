\chapter{Higher-Rank Polymorphism with Application Mode}
\label{chap:BiDirectional}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

This section first presents a declarative, \emph{syntax-directed} type system,
System \ap,
for a lambda calculus with implicit higher-ranked polymorphism. The interesting
aspects about the new type system are: 1) the typing rules, which employ a
combination of inference and a so-called \textit{\mode} modes; 2) the novel
subtyping relation under an application context. Later, we prove our type system
is type-safe by a type directed translation to System F in
\Cref{sec:AP:translation}. An algorithmic type system is discussed in
\Cref{sec:AP:algorithm}.
