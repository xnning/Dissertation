This chapter sets the stage for type systems in later chapters. \Cref{chap:HM}
reviews the Hindley-Milner type system \citep{Damas:Milner,hindley,milner}, a
classical type system for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism. We
first review its syntax and semantics, then discuss the property of
principality, and finally talk briefly about its algorithmic system.
\Cref{chap:OL} presents the Odersky-L{\"a}ufer type system
\citep{odersky:putting}, which extends upon the Hindley-Milner type system by
putting higher-rank type annotations to work. Finally in \Cref{chap:DK} we
introduce the Dunfield-Krishnaswami type system, a bidirecitonal higher-rank
type system.
