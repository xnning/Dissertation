This chapter sets the stage for type systems in later chapters. \Cref{sec:HM}
reviews the Hindley-Milner type system \citep{Damas:Milner,hindley,milner}, a
classical type system for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism.
\Cref{sec:OL} presents the Odersky-L{\"a}ufer type system
\citep{odersky:putting}, which extends upon the Hindley-Milner type system by
putting higher-rank type annotations to work. Finally in \Cref{sec:DK} we
introduce the Dunfield-Krishnaswami type system, a bidirecitonal higher-rank
type system.
