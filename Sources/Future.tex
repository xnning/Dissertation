In this dissertation we have studied type inference and extensions of
predicative implicit higher-rank polymorphism. Specifically, the dissertation
consists of three main technical parts: bidirectional type checking for
higher-rank polymorphism with the new \textit{\mode} mode, integration of
higher-rank polymorphism and gradual typing, and a strategy called \textit{type
  promotion} that helps build simpler solving process that can be applied to polymorphic
subtyping and the kind inference algorithm for datatypes.

In this section we discuss some future directions we would like to pursue.
