\textit{Consistent subtyping} is employed in some gradual type systems to validate type
conversions. The original definition by \citet{siek2007gradual} serves as
a guideline for designing gradual type systems with subtyping. Polymorphic
types \`a la System F also induce a subtyping relation that relates
polymorphic types to their instantiations. However
\citeauthor{siek2007gradual}'s definition is not adequate for polymorphic
subtyping.
This section first proposes a generalization of consistent subtyping
(\Cref{sec:gradual:exploration}) that is adequate for polymorphic subtyping, and
subsumes the original definition by \citeauthor{siek2007gradual}. The new
definition of consistent subtyping provides novel insights with respect to
previous polymorphic gradual type systems, which did not employ consistent
subtyping.

We then present \gpc, a gradually typed calculus for implicit
higher-rank polymorphism that uses our new notion of consistent subtyping. We
develop both declarative (\Cref{sec:gradual:type-system}) and bidirectional
algorithmic versions (\Cref{sec:gradual:algorithm}) for the type system. The
algorithmic version employs techniques developed by DK \citep{DK} for
higher-rank polymorphism to deal with instantiation.
